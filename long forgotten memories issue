hello im trying to take scarab lord title thats why im doing the quest chain but i took quest "long forgotten memories" (name)
but when i tried to do this quest there was bug thats why i left this quest and tried to take it back again.
when i left the quest i turn in back npc (anachronos in caverns of time) but i could not take becasue there is not quest in npc anymore.
I need help about it.It happened to me again for different quest.they fixed it in game.
